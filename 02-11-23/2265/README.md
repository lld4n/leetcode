Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.

The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.
